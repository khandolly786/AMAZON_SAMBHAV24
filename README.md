# Blockchain-Based Sustainable Product Certification and Rewards Platform

## Overview

The **Blockchain-Based Sustainable Product Certification and Rewards Platform** is a revolutionary system designed to certify eco-friendly products using blockchain technology. By leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain, this platform ensures that sustainable claims made by manufacturers are verifiable and trusted by consumers. In addition, the platform incentivizes eco-friendly practices by offering rewards to both sellers and buyers. This decentralized solution encourages transparency, consumer engagement, and a sustainable future.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-based Certification**: Certifies eco-friendly products with immutable, verifiable data.
- **Rewards System**: Incentivizes sellers for adopting sustainable practices and buyers for purchasing certified products.
- **Transparency & Security**: All certifications are stored securely and transparently on the blockchain.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and easy-to-use platform for both sellers and buyers.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS  
- **Tools**: Web3.js, Metamask  

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khandolly786/AMAZON_SAMBHAV24
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```
Navigate to the backend and frontend directories and install the required dependencies.

Backend (Node.js):
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Frontend (React.js):
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
```
### 3. Setup Environment Variables
In both the backend and frontend directories, set up the necessary environment variables (like database connection strings and blockchain credentials) in the .env file.

Example .env file for backend:

makefile
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER_URL=your_ethereum_provider_url

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
Start the backend and frontend servers:

Backend:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Frontend:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and http://localhost:5000 for the backend.
```
### Architecture Overview
The platform is built with the following architecture:

Frontend (React.js): The user interface where users can interact with the platform to view certified products, apply for certification, and view rewards.
Backend (Node.js): Handles business logic, user requests, and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain for certification transactions.
Blockchain (Ethereum): Smart contracts are deployed to verify product sustainability claims and issue blockchain-based certificates.
Database (MongoDB): Stores user data, product details, certification requests, and rewards.
